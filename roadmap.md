🌲 Grove Prototype – Roadmap (v0.1 → v0.2)

✅ Highest Priority (Unblockers / Signals First)

[x] Early Prototype

[x] Chart

[x] GitHub Pages Landing Page → principia-lab.github.io/grove-prototype

✅ Next Priority (Momentum Builders)

[x] README.md

[x] Merge grove-prototype + grove-sprint-logger + grove-early-christmas-lottery → Unified Grove Project with AI-enhanced Sprint Logger

[x] Grove Project Log “what we tried, saw, learned” 

[x] Update Tagline + Short Presentation (GitHub + LinkedIn) system 

[ ] Updated Interactive Chart (10 bars)

[ ] GitHub + LinkedIn refresh.

✅ Second Wave (Prototype Depth)

[x] Show named materials + collaborators + verdicts.

[ ] Placeholders work → visible prototype.

[ ] Screen-Recorded Demo

[ ] Short Loom / gif walkthrough: constraints → GPT shortlist.

[ ] Lightweight, powerful async demo.

✅ Later Updates (Low priority until interactive demo is stable)

[ ] Visual Assets (ambient motifs, diagrams, simple illustrations)

[ ] Style Sheets (expand design system, custom typography/colors/color accents per style guide)

[ ] Minimal illustrations / motifs to give aesthetic identity. e.g. ambient (ASCII patterns, SVG waves, gradient overlays).
