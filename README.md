# 🌲 Grove Project

Unified Grove Project with AI-enhanced Sprint Logger

AI Scientific R&D Foresight Lab

Building GPT x Scientific Discovery workflows for new energy materials

---

## Goal 

To help researchers rapidly identify top candidate materials in energy systems to ensure improved infrastructure. 

---

## How it works 

Enter your constraints: conductivity, stability, cost, etc. → GPT returns a shortlist of materials with reasoning.

---

## Why 

Potential breakthroughs → improved new energy materials and system → safer, efficient, more resilient infrastructure adaptive to changing, uncertain conditions, less costs etc. This is a step toward scientific research co-pilots for next-gen lab, AI-human lab async workflows, supporting structured hypothesis development for scientific discovery, starting with energy materials science. The broader aim is to enable scientific discovery in Quantum materials exploration, Superconductors and energy-transmission systems, Solar, Hydro, Climate-resilient polymers, Catalysts, and Batteries.

## 🛠 TL;DR Modular Hub

Hub Functions as Central dashboard + API → all prototypes feed into one “front door”

Early modules (Phase 1) → concrete ROI, tangible results

Intermediate modules (Phase 2) → hypothesis generation, multi-modal reasoning

Long-term modules (Phase 3) → meta-level prioritization, cognitive modeling

## Log 

Logbook.md 

> Reflection: One thing realized while building this, **a clean correspondence layer, i.e. Sprint Logger for transmission (README, Logbook, GitHub Pages) is itself a prototype**. It helps automate, sieve through data, test how ideas resonate, frame experiments, and attract collaborators as well as investors, also applicable outside the lab.  

- **2025-09-26**: Defined core use case, refined prototypeable shape, outlined repo + comms strategy.  
- Next update: Add first visual asset + interactive element.  

---

## Build, Test, Iterate

- **Prototype**: simple GPT-powered workflow → input constraints (conductivity, stability, cost) → shortlist of candidate materials.  
- **Experiment**: behind-the-scenes testing of constraint–response loop.  
- **Vision**: early signal toward AI-augmented scientific discovery workflows.  

---

## Demo

- GitHub Pages Preview: [principia-lab.github.io/grove-prototype](https://principia-lab.github.io/grove-prototype/)  
- Screen-record / screenshot demo → coming soon

---

## Next Steps

- Refine **grove-prototype v2**  
  - Interactive chart top ten (10 bars, named materials, collaborators, verdicts)  
  - Inputs/outputs more structured  
- Loop integration: reflection + revision → async, collaborative reasoning 
- Integrate **materials property database + literature API** (Materials Project, Semantic Scholar, Elicit)   
- Build tradeoff visualizer  
- Demo: short screen-record / screenshot

## 🚋 Tracking Plan

Outlines what metrics we’re measuring and how

## Core Metrics

### 1. Accuracy
- % of correct responses to memory-based verification
- False positives/negatives if auto-validated

### 2. Latency
- Time from link click → verification complete
- Backend response times

### 3. Engagement
- Link open rate
- Completion rate
- Avg. time on page

### 4. Reconnection
- % who accept/reply after verifying
- Optional: follow-up message sentiment

---

## Collection Methods

- Manual event logging during test demos
- Optional future use: PostHog / Plausible
- Lightweight surveys or in-flow feedback

---

## Status

- [ ] Metrics collection not started  
- [ ] Simulated data added  
- [ ] Real demo run complete  
- [ ] Feedback synthesis in progress
