Building GPT x Scientific Discovery workflows for new energy materials

---

## Goal 

To help researchers rapidly identify top candidate materials in energy systems to ensure improved infrastructure. 

---

## How it works 

Enter your constraints: conductivity, stability, cost, etc. → GPT returns a shortlist of materials with reasoning.

---

## Why 

Potential breakthroughs → improved new energy materials and system → safer, efficient, more resilient infrastructure adaptive to changing, uncertain conditions, less costs etc. This is a step toward scientific research co-pilots for next-gen lab, AI-human lab async workflows, supporting structured hypothesis development for scientific discovery, starting with energy materials science. The broader aim is to enable scientific discovery in Quantum materials exploration, Superconductors and energy-transmission systems, Solar, Hydro, Climate-resilient polymers, Catalysts, and Batteries.

Phase 0: Single Entry Point

Objective: Build one entry portal that funnels modular prototypes and outputs, i.e. acts as a “hub” for collaborators, data, and demonstrations.

Hub Features:

Frontend UI dashboard (Web or Jupyter-based → index.html + scripts.js) 
Backend AI engine (Node.js Serverless) and GitHub sync 
Modular plug-ins for AI Task Processor (tasksProcessor.js), lab automation, literature analysis, discovery
Trajectory Visualization (Interactive examples to show real-world impact)

Purpose: Collect credibility, early traction, and showcase ROI to partners or funders.

---

Phase 1: AI for Materials Discovery (Energy Focus)

Why: Concrete, high-impact domain
Well-documented datasets and pipelines 
Modularity: Each prototype feeds data/insights into the central hub, showing cohesive AI capability while remaining independent.
Clear industrial, academic, and policy stakes

Small Prototype Examples: Materials Property Predictor

Input: chemical formula / structure features
Output: predicted conductivity, stability, or energy density
Model: lightweight ML (RF, XGBoost) for 24h prototype
Visualization: scatter plot of predicted vs known properties
ROI: early insights for labs, startups, or energy companies

Experimental Outcome Forecaster

Input: historical lab experiments, process parameters
Output: probability of success / yield
Model: tabular regression or Bayesian model for uncertainty
Visualization: dashboard with top features influencing success
ROI: labs save time and resources; funding interest

Literature Trend Radar (Domain-Specific)

Input: scraped papers on energy materials
Output: clusters of emerging research directions, novelty scoring
Model: NLP embeddings + clustering
Visualization: interactive trend map
ROI: R&D managers, investors, academics get early insights

---

Phase 2: Scientific Hypothesis Generation

Why: Builds on credibility and datasets from Phase 1
Modularity: Hypothesis generation modules sit on top of the Phase 1 hub, leveraging existing pipelines.
Moves from predictions on known data → AI-assisted generation of testable hypotheses
Models must handle uncertainty, missing data, and interdisciplinary integration

Prototype Examples:

Hypothesis Suggestion Engine
Input: Materials datasets + literature embeddings
Output: Ranked list of plausible new experiments / materials to test
Visualization: network showing connections between known data and new hypotheses
ROI: labs or funders see actionable leads

Multi-Modal Data Integrator

Input: combine lab results, simulations, literature insights
Output: context-aware suggestions for research directions
Prototype: proof-of-concept for integrating heterogeneous scientific data

---

Phase 3: Cognitive Science + Meta-Reasoning

Why: Theoretical, interdisciplinary, requires AI models that reason about reasoning
Modularity: These advanced modules plug into the same hub, showing continuity and the path from concrete energy-focused discoveries → generalized scientific reasoning → meta-cognitive AI insights.
Prioritizes which hypotheses or research directions are most promising
Potentially groundbreaking but builds on prior domain-specific success

Prototype Examples:

Hypothesis Prioritization Agent

Input: outputs from Phase 2 + resource constraints + historical success metrics
Output: ranked list of hypotheses for highest impact / feasibility
Visualization: “scorecard” with explainable reasoning
ROI: optimizes research investments and strategic decision-making

Meta-Research Modeling

Input: broader scientific knowledge graph
Output: suggested new interdisciplinary experiments or collaborations

Prototype: AI agent reasoning across domains

🛠 TL;DR Modular Hub

Hub Functions as Central dashboard + API → all prototypes feed into one “front door”

Early modules (Phase 1) → concrete ROI, tangible results
Intermediate modules (Phase 2) → hypothesis generation, multi-modal reasoning
Long-term modules (Phase 3) → meta-level prioritization, cognitive modeling

Traction Strategy:

Early wins in Phase 1 → credibility, funding, collaborators
Phase 2 → differentiates lab as thought leader in AI-assisted discovery
Phase 3 → ambitious, high-profile research → potential breakthrough / publications / partnerships

## Log 

Logbook.md 

> Reflection: One thing realized while building this **a clean correspondence layer, i.e. Sprint Logger for transmission (README, Logbook, GitHub Pages) is itself a prototype**. It helps automate, sieve through data, test how ideas resonate, frame experiments, and attract collaborators and investors, as it is also applicable outside the lab.  

- **2025-09-26**: Defined core use case, refined prototypeable shape, outlined repo + comms strategy.  
- Next update: Add first visual asset + interactive element.
