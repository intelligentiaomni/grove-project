# 🌲 Grove Project

Unified Grove Project with AI-enhanced Sprint Logger

AI Scientific R&D Foresight Lab

Building GPT x Scientific Discovery workflows for new energy materials

---

## Goal 

To help researchers rapidly identify top candidate materials in energy systems to ensure improved infrastructure. 

---

## How it works 

Enter your constraints: conductivity, stability, cost, etc. → GPT returns a shortlist of materials with reasoning.

---

## Why 

Potential breakthroughs → improved new energy materials and system → safer, efficient, more resilient infrastructure adaptive to changing, uncertain conditions, less costs etc. This is a step toward scientific research co-pilots for next-gen lab, AI-human lab async workflows, supporting structured hypothesis development for scientific discovery, starting with energy materials science. The broader aim is to enable scientific discovery in Quantum materials exploration, Superconductors and energy-transmission systems, Solar, Hydro, Climate-resilient polymers, Catalysts, and Batteries.

## 🛠 TL;DR Modular Hub

Hub Functions as Central dashboard + API → all prototypes feed into one “front door”
```
Early modules (Phase 1) → concrete ROI, tangible results
```
Intermediate modules (Phase 2) → hypothesis generation, multi-modal reasoning
```
Long-term modules (Phase 3) → meta-level prioritization, cognitive modeling
```
---

## Traction Strategy:

Early wins in Phase 1 → credibility, funding, collaborators
```
Phase 2 → differentiates lab as thought leader in AI-assisted discovery
```
Phase 3 → ambitious, high-profile research → potential breakthrough / publications / partnerships
```
---
Phase 0: Single Entry Point
```
Objective: Build one entry portal that funnels modular prototypes and outputs, i.e. acts as a “hub” for collaborators, data, and demonstrations.
```
Hub Features:

Frontend UI dashboard (Web or Jupyter-based → index.html + scripts.js) `
```
Backend AI engine (Node.js Serverless) and GitHub sync 
```
Modular plug-ins for AI Task Processor (tasksProcessor.js), lab automation, literature analysis, discovery
```
Trajectory Visualization (Interactive examples to show real-world impact)
```
Purpose: Collect credibility, early traction, and showcase ROI to partners or funders.
```
---

Phase 1: AI for Materials Discovery (Energy Focus)

```
---
```
Phase 3: Cognitive Science + Meta-Reasoning
```
Why: Theoretical, interdisciplinary, requires AI models that reason about reasoning
```
Modularity: These advanced modules plug into the same hub, showing continuity and the path from concrete energy-focused discoveries → generalized scientific reasoning → meta-cognitive AI insights.
```
Prioritizes which hypotheses or research directions are most promising
```
Potentially groundbreaking but builds on prior domain-specific success
```
Prototype Examples:
```
Hypothesis Prioritization Agent
```
Input: Outputs from Phase 2 + resource constraints + historical success metrics

- **Markdown-first** → all sessions are stored as `.md`.  
- **Structure** → follow the sections: TL;DR, Reflections, Next Steps.  
- **Async-friendly** → write so others can quickly catch up.  

## File Structure
- `grove-sprint-logger.html` → main logger interface (form + API link).  
- `sessions/` → saved sprint logs (one per session).  
- `modules/` → focused module logs (e.g. Time-boxed experiments).

## Team

**Scientist Team (Sep 2025)**  
- Continuity Researcher *Aletheia*  
- Scientific Researcher *Lee*  

**Supporting Team**  
- Grove Sprint Logger  
- Future collaborators  

## Founder

**Meet LS Lee**  
Lee’s path began in mathematics, driven by the principle that scientific research is one of the most promising ways to address urgent global challenges. Mathematics — the language of the universe — serves as the foundation for this quest.

The lab is cultivating an environment where mathematically minded students and scientific researchers not only excel, but also develop the intellectual operating systems and human qualities required to become the next generation of torchbearers and innovators.

## Origins

Lee grew up in a family circle shaped by technology and education:  
- Father worked as a computer engineer at IBM in his youth  
- Mother worked as a teacher  

Independent reading before preschool, paired with early music training and competitive athletics, built a foundation of achievement and collaboration. These early experiences instilled both a drive for excellence and a commitment “to win” — qualities that now fuel this initiative, directed toward scientific curiosity and truth-seeking.

## Gratitude

> “I deeply thank the mentors who have supported me throughout this process — in person, in correspondence, and in thought. Your trust, cleverness, rigor, and inspiration are underestimated far too often. The quiet strength and compassion of my parents also continue to guide me every day.”  
— *LS Lee*
