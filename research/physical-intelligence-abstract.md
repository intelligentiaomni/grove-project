# Physical Intelligence for Research Autonomy: A Grove Project Lab Experiment

#### Abstract

This Grove project experiment explores how embodied AI systems can enhance researcher autonomy through transparent human–robot collaboration in physical environments. Early-stage researchers and independent builders often face logistical barriers, for example moving materials, archiving prototypes, managing temporary or remote storage that hinder creativity and confidence.

We hypothesize that combining **AI-driven coordination** with **transparent embodied systems** can reduce these burdens while reinforcing user agency.

The experiment integrates four layers of intelligence:

**Physical**: Mobile robots (AMRs or leased warehouse units) for safe, trackable material handling.<br>
**Digital Twin**: Indexing and spatial mapping of storage using IoT sensors and Grove Project’s digital dashboard.<br>
**Cognitive**: Grove project’s reasoning engine directs physical tasks via natural language instructions (“Move box G-17 to Zone B”) and contextual memory.<br>
**Community**: A co-creative platform where builders design, test, and audit robotic behaviors to ensure fairness, clarity, and trust.<br>

The outcome will be a functional digital twin of a physical lab storage, an index system for spatial reasoning, and a pilot framework for autonomous research logistics. By blending robotics, cognition, and community oversight, this Grove project lab experiment aims to transform the logistics of research into a domain of embodied intelligence, one that strengthens autonomy rather than replacing it.
