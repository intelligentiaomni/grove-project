🎙️ Choose Your Guide (Optional Prompt at Start)
Upon entering the Hall of Origins, the player is prompted:
“Would you like a companion to guide you through the origins of intelligence, technology, and discovery?”
If yes, they get to select from a list of voice + character shells, each inspired by beloved actors/figures:
Voice/Shell Option
Tone & Style
Customization
Zendaya-inspired character
Curious, grounded, emotionally intelligent
Hair, outfit, name, pronouns
Timothée Chalamet-inspired
Reflective, poetic, with spark of rebellion
Eye color, voice mod
Karl Urban (McCoy-style)
Dry humor, skeptical scientist vibe
Lab coat or explorer gear
Dylan Sprouse-style coder
Energetic, code-nerd energy
Hoodie, gear colors
Morgan Freeman-style voice
Calm, wise, philosophical tone
Voice-only or AI orb visual
Meryl Streep-style voice
Empathic, narrative-rich
Classical look or abstract form


🌱 Gameplay Layer:
The AI guide can narrate, ask reflective questions, or help players connect the dots as they explore.


This also creates a mentor dynamic—echoing the real-life importance of mentors in research and development.


Later in the game, players might unlock new voices or hybrid AI styles as their understanding deepens.

Users can % mix & blend to customize shells, avatars, voice

Yes — a PRD **can** include a representation of the repository (or code) structure tree, especially when it helps clarify how components are organized or how new parts should fit in. It’s optional, but often quite useful.

Here’s when and how you might include it (and what to watch out for):

---

## Why include a repository structure tree in a PRD?

Including a repo structure tree helps with:

* **Context & orientation**: showing where the new modules, files, or features live in relation to the existing code.
* **Clarity for engineers**: giving a visual guide to where exactly new files, folders, or components should be placed.
* **Consistency & planning**: ensuring everyone agrees on naming, organization, and modularization before implementation.
* **Detecting conflicts**: spotting structural clashes (e.g. two features wanting to live in the same folder) early.

So it enhances the “what” part of “what’s being built” by situating it within the larger codebase.

---

## How to include it (best practices)

Here are practical suggestions and caveats:

### 1. Keep it manageable in size

Don’t dump the entire massive repository tree — that may overwhelm readers. Instead:

* Show **relevant slices**: the part of the tree where the new feature or module lives, plus a few parent levels.
* Use ellipses “…” or abstraction to omit irrelevant subtrees.
* Use a simplified or “idealized” structure rather than the full current chaos.

### 2. Use a clear visual (ASCII / Markdown / graphical)

You can use simple text-tree syntax (ASCII style), embed in Markdown, or provide a small diagram. For example:

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── FeatureX/
│   │   └── FeatureY/
│   ├── services/
│   └── utils/
└── tests/
    ├── FeatureX/
    └── FeatureY/
```

You could also provide a more polished visual (e.g. in a diagram) if your PRD is visually rich (PDF, slide, etc.).

### 3. Annotate it

Next to or beneath the tree, add annotations for:

* New folders / files to be created
* Places where changes will occur
* Constraints or naming conventions
* Where dependencies link in

### 4. Keep it in sync (version it / update)

Because codebases evolve, the structural tree portion of a PRD must stay current. If the repository structure changes significantly, update the tree portion or note that it may evolve.

### 5. Separate conceptual vs physical structure

If your architecture divides into logical modules (e.g. microservices, domain modules) and physical repository layout, you may want two views:

* **Logical module view** (how features are grouped conceptually)
* **Physical file system / repo view** (how it maps to folders & files)

The PRD can show both, to help engineers map logic to physical structure.

## Example of including it in a PRD

Here’s a minimal snippet of how you might embed a repo structure in a PRD:

---

### Code Structure (Relevant Snapshot)

```
MyProduct/
├── backend/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── payment/
│   └── models/
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── views/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── assets/
└── tests/
    ├── backend/
    └── frontend/
```

**Changes for Feature Z**

* Add `backend/services/notification/`
* Add `frontend/src/components/NotificationPanel`
* Add tests under `tests/frontend/NotificationPanel`

If you like, I can help you **draft a PRD section** with a repository tree for a specific example or use case (e.g. for a web app, mobile app, etc.). Do you want me to make such an example for your project?
