# A Grove Project Lab experiment for Physical Intelligence

**Embodied AI for Builders**

---

## Purpose
Exploring how **embodied intelligence** can help early builders move knowledge, materials, and prototypes, bridging the digital and the physical. What began as a storage challenge became an experiment in **autonomous research**.  

---

## Overview
This Grove Project Lab experiment explores how a simple storage unit can become a living intelligence system — linking robotics, AI reasoning, and builder collaboration. The goal: help small labs and early-stage teams orchestrate their physical environments as intelligently as their digital ones.

## System Layers

| Layer | What we're testing | Example tools |
|-------|--------------------|---------------|
| Physical Layer | Mobile robot moving boxes (leased AMR or mini bot) | AWS RoboMaker / Boston Dynamics Spot SDK |
| Digital Twin | Index items via QR, sensors, Grove dashboard | AWS IoT TwinMaker |
| Cognitive Layer | AI agent coordinating tasks (“Move box G-17 to Zone B”) | Grove Reasoning Engine + LLM |
| Community Layer | Builders co-create robot behaviors, visualizations | Grove Builder Game / Reputation Layer |

## Technical Stack (sponsor-aligned)

- **AWS RoboMaker** — cloud-based robotics simulation  
- **AWS IoT Core + TwinMaker** — link sensors and create a digital twin  
- **Amazon Bedrock / SageMaker** — host Grove reasoning models  
- **Unity / WebGL visualizer** — *Grove Storage Map* (interactive)  
- **ROS2 SDKs** — open-source robotics foundation for the community

## Why it matters
Small labs and independent researchers often face “physical entropy”: boxes, prototypes, and components scattered across spaces. Grove Project's Physical Intelligence Lab transforms that real-world problem into an experiment in **autonomous research, agency, and embodied coordination**.

*A Grove Project Lab experiment helps early builders become more autonomous, turning the logistics of creation into a living part of the research ecosystem.*

---

## Activation Path
1. Start under **AWS Activate for Startups** — apply for AI/IoT credits.  
2. Engage **AWS Sweden Innovation Hub** — explore robotics pilot programs.  
3. Seek in-kind compute or hardware support — “infrastructure for embodied builders.”

## Expected outcomes
- Functional **Digital Twin** of a real Grove storage unit  
- Prototype **Grove Index System (GIS)** for spatial reasoning  
- Open demo + small dataset for robotics learning  
- Story and results feeding back into Grove’s **Tradeoff Visualizer** and **Builder Game**

---

## Vision
*A Grove Lab for Physical Intelligence is where digital reasoning meets the physical world, a small autonomous room that learns alongside its builders.*
